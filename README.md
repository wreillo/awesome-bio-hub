# Awesome Omics
A collection of bioinformatic tools for the analysis of omics data.

Motivated by [awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php) and [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)!

Since "OMICS" encompass a broad spectrum, the awesome-omics collection is splitted by disciplines.

## Disciplines 
* Metagenomics
* Metatranscriptomics
