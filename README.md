# Awesome Omics
A collection of bioinformatic tools for the analysis of omics data.

Analyzing OMICS data can be challenging and even more when not knowing which bioinformatic tool to use. In an effort to help graduate students/post-docs/researchers, this effort was established. Also, the [awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php) and [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) repositories served as a motivation.

Since "OMICS" encompass a broad spectrum, the awesome-omics collection is splitted by disciplines (e.g., metagenomics) and sections (e.g., quality control, annotation, etc.) to provide an idea of the general use for the tool. If the awesome tool can be used in more than one discipline, then make sure to capture it on your contribution.
