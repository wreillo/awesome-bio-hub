# Awesome Omics
A collection of bioinformatic tools for the analysis of omics data.

Motivated by [awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php), [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python), and helping others with a centralized location of awesome tools for analyzing your precious data!

Since "OMICS" encompass a broad spectrum, the awesome-omics collection is splitted by disciplines (e.g., metagenomics) and sections (e.g., quality control, annotation, etc.) to provide an idea of the general use for the tool. If your awesome tool can be used in more than one discipline, then make sure to capture it on your contribution.

## Disciplines 
* [Metagenomics](METAGENOMICS.md)
  * [Quality Control](METAGENOMICS.md#quality-control)
  * [Assembly](METAGENOMICS.md#assembly)
  * [Annotation](METAGENOMICS.md#annotation)
* [Metatranscriptomics](METATRANSCRIPTOMICS.md)
  * [Quality Control](METATRANSCRIPTOMICS.md#quality-control)
  * [Assembly](METATRANSCRIPTOMICS.md#assembly)
  * [Annotation](METATRANSCRIPTOMICS.md#annotation)


## Contributions
Hello science fellows! Did you used of a tool that help you with analyzing your omic data? You think is worth for others to know about it. If so, then make your contribution! In order to keep things organized, please make sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTIONS.md).
